The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 19.4% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 90.6% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 16.7% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 15.1 hours of data, or 12.1 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 6.6% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (24,46.0,162)
